-  pip install numpy nltk tensorflow sklearn

-  used adam optimizer for ann training (can use gradient decent instead "fast and robust")

Rasa
Rasa is an open-source framework designed for building conversational AI applications. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for intent recognition, dialogue management, and contextual understanding.

Key Features:
Intent Recognition:

Training Data: Rasa uses machine learning to understand user inputs and can be trained on labeled datasets containing intents and example phrases.
Natural Language Understanding (NLU): It processes user inputs to identify intents and extract entities (specific pieces of information like names, dates, etc.).
Customizability:

Rasa allows developers to define custom intents and create complex dialogue flows.
You can write your own training algorithms or use Rasa's built-in models.
Dialogue Management:

Rasa uses a state machine to manage conversation flow, allowing for context-based responses.
It supports multi-turn conversations, where context is maintained across multiple user inputs.
Integration:

Rasa can be integrated with various messaging platforms (e.g., Slack, Facebook Messenger, etc.) and backend systems (e.g., APIs, databases).
Active Learning:

Rasa provides a feedback loop where it can learn from user interactions to improve intent recognition over time.
Community and Documentation:

Being open-source, Rasa has a robust community and extensive documentation that can help with implementation and troubleshooting.
Use Case:
Building a Customer Support Chatbot: A business can use Rasa to develop a chatbot that understands customer inquiries about products, order statuses, and returns, using machine learning to continuously improve based on user interactions.
